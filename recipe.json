        "description": `For the Chicken
        Add oil to a large pot and heat over medium. Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper.
        Cook, until the chicken is cooked all the way through, about 10 minutes, flipping once in between.
        Remove the chicken onto a paper towel-covered plate to drain of excess oil. Set aside.
        For the Rice
        Add the vegetable oil to the same pot and heat over medium. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
        Add the garlic, habanero peppers and tomatoes. Cook another 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        Add the tomato paste and stir the mixture to combine.
        Add the rice and stir the mixture to combine.
        Add the chicken stock, cinnamon stick and salt and pepper (to taste). Stir well and bring to a boil on high heat.
        Once boiling, cover the pot and decrease the heat to "low." Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is cooked and liquids are absorbed, about 12 minutes.`,
